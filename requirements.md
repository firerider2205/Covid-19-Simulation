# For the file to run efficiently, we need some modules(or libraries)

- random(pre-installed with python3.9)
- time(pre-installed with python3.9)
- colorama(pre-installed with python3.9)
- sys(pre-installed with python3.9)
- os(pre-installed with python3.9)

If not installed, do:
Windows - `pip install <module name>`
Linux - `pip3 install <module name>`

## And of course, Python
I would suggest using python 3.7 or higher. I am currently using 3.9
