# For the file to run efficiently, we need some modules(or libraries)

- random (pre-installed with python3.9)
- time (pre-installed with python3.9)
- colorama (pre-installed with python3.9)
- sys (pre-installed with python3.9)
- os (pre-installed with python3.9)

If not installed, do:

Windows - `pip install <module name>`

Linux - `pip3 install <module name>`

## And of course, Python
I would suggest using python 3.7 or higher. I am currently using 3.9
