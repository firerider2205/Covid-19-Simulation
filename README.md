# Covid-19 Simulation
Just a simple, un-completed, TUI simulation of Covid-19 going from one person to another.

## Covid-19 
I have made a simple simulation with python on its transferability.

## How to Run
I use linux, so the commands I have used are `os.system('clear')`.

If you use Windows, change it to `os.system('cls')`.


Simply run with 

Windows:

  `python covid-19_sim.py`
  
  
OR Linux(Maybe Mac-os also):

  `python3 covid-19_sim.py`


# Keep in Mind that this is not completely finished, and may not give the desired results!!!
