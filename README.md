# covid-19_simulation.py
Just a simple, un-completed, TUI simulation of Covid-19 going from one person to another.

## Covid-19 
I have made a simple simulation with python on its transferability.

## How to Run
I use linux, so the commands I have used are `os.system('clear')`.
If you use Windows, change it to `os.system('cls')`.

Simply run with 
Windows:
  `python covid-19_sim.py`
OR Linux(Maybe Mac-os also):
  `python3 covid-19_sim.py`
  
# Keep in Mind that this is not completely finished, and may not give the desired results!!!
